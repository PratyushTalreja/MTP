Jetson TK1 is a first mobile processor from NVIDIA having similar features and architecture as that of a modern desktop GPU and still using low power from a mobile chip. Therefore, Jetson TK1 runs the same CUDA code (running on desktop GPU) with similar level of performance. Also, with the dawn of GPU technology, it has become possible to perform tasks that are computationally in- tensive (i.e. those taking lots of computation) in real or near real time. In the agriculture domain, retrieving the biophysical parameters of the crop is important as it provides insights into the plant growth status. Inversion of radiative transfer models enables to obtain these parameters. However, such a procedure is highly computationally intensive. The focus of this work is to develop and implement ap- proaches that take advantage of embedded high performance computing capability of Jetson TK1 to significantly improve the inversion process of a canopy reflectance model. The experimental results show that Jetson TK1 based biophysical param- eters estimation gives significant speedup, which opens up the possibility of having a Jetson based embedded platform for on-board biophysical parameters estimation in the future. In such a scenario, where there are constraints related to energy and power, Jetson TK1 can become a practicable option by providing a GPU- based architecture for running energy-aware computationally intensive algorithms in parallel for processing the data, and generate results in real or near-real time while taking care of the power usage.
